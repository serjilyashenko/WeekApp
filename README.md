While I created my own date functions from scratch for fun, I highly recommend using third-party libraries such as
`date-fns` or `luxon` for production code. These libraries have been thoroughly tested, optimized for performance, and
offer a wide range of useful features. By using them, you can avoid common errors and edge cases that may arise when
working with dates.

**Note:** There is no RTL. First I want to test my date functions. RTL may be added later.
